## Good Afternoon All of you..!!
  
#### Here you will get the questions link on a start of every new round..!!  
  
#### Instruction:


Please read the following instructions carefully before proceeding with the exam tasks. Adherence to these guidelines is essential for a fair and successful competition.

1. Model Usage: You are required to use the ChatGPT 3.5 model specified for this competition. Using any other version or AI tool will lead to disqualification.  
      
2. Single-Prompt Response: Your answer to each task must be submitted as a single prompt response. Do not engage in a back-and-forth conversation with the AI. Craft your prompt carefully to elicit a comprehensive and relevant response in one go.  
      
3. Originality: Your prompts must be original and entirely your own work. Plagiarism or copying from external sources will result in immediate disqualification.  
      
4. Clarity and Precision: Ensure your prompts are clear, concise, and directed towards the specific task at hand. Ambiguous or overly broad prompts may not yield useful responses from the AI.  
      
5. Prompt Length: While there is no strict word limit for your prompts, aim for brevity and relevance. Unnecessarily lengthy prompts that do not contribute to clarity or effectiveness may impact your score negatively.  
      
6. Deadline Compliance: Submit your completed exam paper within the allotted time frame. Late submissions will not be accepted under any circumstances.  
      
7. Ethical Considerations: Ensure that your prompts do not promote unethical behaviour, discrimination, or harm. Prompts should be respectful, culturally sensitive, and adhere to the principles of ethical AI use.   
      
8. Confidentiality: Do not share your exam responses or discuss the specifics of the tasks with other participants until after the competition results are announced. This maintains the integrity and fairness of the competition.  
      
9. Repeat Submission: Please note that each question should be submitted only once. In the event of multiple submissions for the same question, only the first entry will be considered, and any subsequent entries will be automatically eliminated.

## Judging Criteria

- Submissions must be clearly articulated and well-presented. This includes the readability and the logical flow of ideas.
- Responses must directly address the prompt with relevant information. More detailed and comprehensive responses will receive higher scores.

- Answers to logical questions that do not include an explanation or attempt to force the AI into a specific answer will be marked down.
- Prompts that demonstrate creativity, originality, and the ability to generate engaging and unique responses will be rewarded.
- Judging will focus on the quality and relevance of the content generated by the AI, rather than the complexity or creativity of the prompt itself (excluding logical questions).
